NFTs for Humanity

NFTs are a new technology that will have a profound impact on how people collaborate, solve problems, and do community work. They enable the creation of a token that can represent anything, abstract or real, and freely trade it. All sorts of virtual contracts can be associated with NFTs, but the highlight and innovation of this new technology is its ability to trace back ownership of the token all the way back to its creation.

This technology could create a completely creative sandbox where artists, entrepreneurs, developers and even scientists could tokenize and post unfinished work, projects, products, and results that can always be certified by blockchain. And if anyone else in the same field is interested in using, reproducing, or even building upon those works and results, the virtual contracts could automatically make sure that copyright and intellectual property are automatically and effortlessly shared between all the parties involved.
However, it is on humanitarian aid that the NFT technology can make the biggest impact. In a world where donating to a charity is an investment, a platform where anyone could donate without monetizing it first but keeping the possibility of cashing back on it in the future would be of unique value. NFTs allow us to do that, and the vision of the NFTs for Humanity projectâ€™s openNFT platform is to bring this dream into reality.

The concept of this project is to create a completely free and communal platform where anyone could contribute in any form to any charity or social program of their choosing. These contributions would be tokenized, and these tokens could then be traded in a free market where anyone who wishes to donate to that cause could do it by buying those tokens. If in the future that person needs that money back, they could always try to sell those tokens back to someone else who supports the same ideas. For example, a painter could contribute a painting to a charity of their choosing. Anyone that wishes to help that charity could buy the tokens associated to that artwork, and the money would go directly and entirely to the charity.

This platform is highly encrypted. Thus, all transactions are made with virtually no risk of fraud. Moreover, all donors will be gifted with artwork from artists that believe in the same causes as them, creating further incentive to use the OpenNFT platform. This could create a market for contributions and a cascade effect of goodwill. As more people contribute, the tokens become more valuable, like in any free market that is growing. This new technology can transform any resource available to humanity into a commodity. As these commodities will be traded in a free market, they will attract speculators, willing to buy and trade donations in an open market. The more microtransactions involved in this system, the more royalties will be generated, and the more money will go to the charities and even back to whoever made the original contribution in the first place. This market will follow patterns like other cryptocurrencies and will be able to raise large funds to charity. A donation market like this would grow continuously over time, meaning that the earlier you donate, the more money you can make. 

This is the vision, the goal, and the ambition of the NFTs for Humanity project and we invite you to join us to make it a reality.
